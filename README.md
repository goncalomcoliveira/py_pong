# py_pong

A **PONG** game developed in python with py_game

### Introduction

**py_pong** is an adaptation of the retro game PONG made in 2019, built using *py_game* and implementing [**Pygame_Function**s](https://github.com/StevePaget/Pygame_Functions) from Steve Paget.

This project was made to fulfill following main goals:
* explore game developing for the first time;
* have a first go at a programming project.

### Sprites

The simplistic sprites were all created by me with the aid of the [**Aseprite**](https://www.aseprite.org), a pixel-art creation software.

### Sound

The sound effects where created by me, using [**sfxr**](https://sfxr.me) as a way to generate 8-Bit sound effects akin to the ones found in retro games.
The background music was obtained in a royalty free music provider website (website unknown).

### Notes

> ### Creator's Words
> I've always had a special appreciation for the art of game development. Not in a "I play games all day and want to make them one day" sort of way, but more of a "I read books, heard podcasts and watched documentataries about game development for 6 years straight" way, if that makes any sense.
> As the years went by and I indulged myself in the many hobbies I love doing every since I was a kid, such as making music and drawing, I always wondered what I could do to bring them together. This was the art form I found and that i still cultivate today. I truly have a lot of fun still creating projects to this day and will probably continue having this much fun as long as life leaves me the time to do it.
> This was the first project I dwelved into where I could have a taste of game development, which makes me proud and also notice how much I've learned since then.
